# Code Less, Babylon More
## What is _r ?

_r is a lightweight, "write less, do more", BabylonJS library. The purpose of _r is to make it much easier to use and maintain BabylonJS settings in the 3D workflow.

_r takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

_r also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from BabylonJS, like materials, animations,  etc.
