# Code Less, Babylon More
## What is _r ?

_r is a lightweight, "write less, do more", BabylonJS library. The purpose of _r is to make it much easier to use and maintain BabylonJS settings in the 3D workflow.

_r takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

_r also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from BabylonJS, like materials, animations,  etc.

For 3D Designer
From a 3D designers point of view there are always a lot of parameters - like colors, channel intensity, reflection, refraction, etc - which needs to be customised by code. Code is great but itâ€™s hard to understand and maintain for a 3D designers team. With _r you can use patch file to customise the scene. Patch are easy to read/write text file
